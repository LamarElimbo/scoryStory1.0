        Movie and tv show soundtracks help to evoke a deeper emotional connection with a given scene.  Fight scenes are often accompanied by something a bit more hardcore when compared to romantic scenes which, in turn, tend to be paired with something a lot softer.

        Music adds a whole new dimension to the viewer's experience and a movie/show lacking in strategically selected and well-placed music may just be missing out on a valuable opportunity to paint a vibrant and relatable picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the vast majority of movies/shows seemed to have picked up on the power of music, most literary works have not.  This is where Scory Story comes in.

        While an ideal version of this app can follow a reader's place in a story in virtual space and play an appropriate non-lyrical song, this current version allows a user to enter text and have it categorized into one of several scene types and return a song with a similar tone.  To see the basic breakdown of how this current version works, visit: <a href='http://www.lamartalkscode.com/scory-story-the-power-of-a-good-soundtrack/'>www.lamartalkscode.com/scory-story-the-power-of-a-good-soundtrack/</a>
